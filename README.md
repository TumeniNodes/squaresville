# squaresville

Squaresville is a simplified world dominated by abandoned cities. This is a stand-alone mapgen. You can't use it with any of the stock mapgens (though it *might* cooperate with other "mapgen" mods).

The world is fairly two-dimensional -- it doesn't generate any caves or dungeons, though it will work with fun_caves. The terrain is based on two-dimensional perlin noise for speed and simplicity. City areas are nearly flat -- only the wilderness has any shape at all. All the default biomes are reimplimented in lua, along with most of the stock decorations.

This is a work in progress.
